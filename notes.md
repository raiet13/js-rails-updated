- Nice to Haves - 

- Log In or Sign Up with Google --> Add sign in with Google (check login or sign up page and use/keep password?)

- Character Show Page 
-> Delete button on "next" not removing original form for some reason, not sure why -- check in/ask reviewer about it (moving on as it isn't directly part of the spec requirements and is taking a while to deal with)
-> Next/Previous able to handle randomly removed characters (will need to reconfigure the functions to remove the previous/next and handle all logic in the button click)

- Character Index Page
    -> Button only works one time and requires page refresh. Not sure why that is... -- moving on for now

- Show Index Page
    -> Be able to tick a checkbox for "record this show" upon jQuery creation of it
    -> Alphabetized by name (on page refresh or navigation to it) -- newly created shows will just be appended "normally"
