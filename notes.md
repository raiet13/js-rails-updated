- Next Steps - 

- JS files not being captured/run by pages... Do I really have to use the coffeescript files?
    -> Tried doing the "content_for" and adding the individual js file to the precompile

- Use jQuery/ajax for TV show/characters
    -> Show Page with "next" (cycle through all shows)
    -> Index Page -> Automatically render all characters from show && click button to show all active user recordings on user profile
    -> "has_many" == use the TV shows to render new characters without a redirect
        -> Show the characters in a Show AND render new characters w/o redirect
