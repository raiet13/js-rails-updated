- Next Steps - 

- Use jQuery/ajax for TV show/characters
    -> Show Page with "next" (cycle through all shows)
    -> Index Page -> Automatically render all characters from show && click button to show all active user recordings on user profile
    -> "has_many" == use the TV shows to render new characters without a redirect
        -> Show the characters in a Show AND render new characters w/o redirect

- For complexity's sake in terms of views, updating above
    -> Show Page with "next" (cycle through all CHARACTERS in a Show)
    -> Create new Characters on the show character index page without refresh (shows/:show_id/characters)
